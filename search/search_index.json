The Caribbean faces global challenges like climate change, rising sea levels, and economic instability\u2014problems that are magnified by a lack of reliable information. When data is missing, governments are forced to act reactively, not proactively. And the consequences are felt not just locally, but globally. SIDS, often on the frontlines of these crises, serve as a warning system for the world. The lessons learned here can inform strategies for resilience and sustainability everywhere.</p> <p>Managing a country without reliable data is like navigating a storm without a map. Caribbean nations must continue investing in data infrastructure, training, and regional cooperation. If we ignore this, the consequences are clear:</p> <ul> <li>Slower disaster recovery \u2192 More lives lost, higher economic damage.</li> <li>Poor resource allocation \u2192 Misplaced aid, inefficient policies.</li> <li>Lack of global competitiveness \u2192 Weak economic strategies.</li> </ul> <p>Investing in data is not about numbers\u2014it\u2019s about saving lives, protecting communities, and ensuring a sustainable future.

These moments rarely make the headlines, yet they can transform how we understand\u2014and improve\u2014the health of our communities. Across the Caribbean, we have abundant talent and world-class research; by refining how we collect, interpret and share our data, we can unlock our full potential. When every piece of information finds its way to the right hands, what could we achieve together? </p> <p>Beneath every successful public-health initiative lies reliable, up-to-date data. While the Caribbean has historically lagged in gathering and refreshing the indicators needed to monitor regional concerns - such as the Sustainable Development Goals and gender inequality - this gap represents a great opportunity. </p> <p>By strengthening national data systems\u2014so that essential metrics are collected, updated, and shared on schedule\u2014we can turn planning from approximation into targeted action. With statistics at our fingertips, we\u2019ll be able to design smarter interventions, mobilize resources more efficiently, and track our progress over time. When our data reflects the depth and diversity of our communities, it becomes a stronger foundation for collective progress.</p> <p>This data ideal will involve a collective journey, so let\u2019s take a closer look at what can happen when we don\u2019t value our data resources. For twenty years from the early 1990s, the Barbados Eye Studies followed more than 4,000 people and produced important findings about eye health in people of African descent. The data shaped international policies and research for years. When the study ended, the team moved on, computer systems aged, and over time the data was forgotten. Today, its whereabouts are unknown \u2014 valuable knowledge lost, not because it lacked importance, but because there were no systems in place to ensure its long-term preservation and reuse.</p> <p></p> <p>In another example from 2015, the Global Burden of Disease study reported that Barbados had one of the healthiest diets in the world<sup>1</sup>. The data behind that claim came from a small group of cancer survivors. So the data were important, but not representative of the whole country. This finding gained international attention, despite local research showing that Barbados faces serious diet-related health challenges, like low fruit and vegetable intake and rising rates of obesity<sup>2</sup>. The mismatch highlights the danger of presenting information without the benefit of local insight.</p> <p>When COVID-19 struck, everyone\u2014from governments to frontline health workers\u2014rose to meet the challenge. Our team of epidemiologists reported on the Caribbean infection rates each morning, piecing together daily information from dozens of separate sources<sup>3</sup>. This puzzle of fragmented data was a consequence of limited resources and decentralized systems. We persisted and mostly succeeded, but we could have done so much more with shared platforms and stronger data infrastructure. By bringing our information streams together, we can respond faster\u2014and with greater coordination\u2014when the next health emergency arrives.</p> <p>Dr Madhuvanti Murphy, member of the Barbados COVID Response Team</p> <p>Not only was the COVID experience traumatic from a lay person\u2019s standpoint, but it was also traumatic from a surveillance standpoint. It was so difficult to work out which were the appropriate surveillance tools and platforms to look at and then to make sure everything aligned. Different sources were presenting information in different ways, which made it really difficult to find any one way to collate all of that information. If there was something more streamlined from a data perspective, it would have made it so much easier for us to really be on top of the surveillance in a way that would have allowed us to do more with the data.</p> <p>These opportunities go beyond simply filling data gaps or speeding up processes\u2014they\u2019re about building stronger support, developing lasting connections, and harnessing our shared commitment to make data serve the region. When we invest in unified platforms and proper data stewardship, the statistics we collect become a lasting asset. By linking health and development databases\u2014and equipping our researchers with the right tools, time, and resources\u2014we\u2019ll encourage insights across borders and disciplines. In doing so, we\u2019ll turn isolated findings into collective progress and \u2013 eventually - make our data work for everyone.</p> <p>CaribData has been set up to help this process. It\u2019s an initiative led by the University of the West Indies, with support from the Inter-American Development Bank, and its mission is simple: to help the Caribbean make better use of the data it already has. That means setting up systems to protect and share data securely, offering training to help researchers communicate their results more clearly, and building a culture of sharing across ministries, universities, and communities. Most importantly, CaribData is about telling better stories with data\u2014ones that reflect local knowledge, inform real decisions, and build trust.</p> <p>Because this isn\u2019t just about data for data\u2019s sake. It\u2019s about using evidence to improve lives. With the right systems and support, the Caribbean can ensure that local research helps shape local solutions\u2014and contribute to global conversations with confidence. CaribData is helping to make that future possible: one where strong data leads to smart choices, and where Caribbean voices are heard, respected, and empowered.</p> About CaribData <p>CaribData is dedicated to transforming data sharing and storytelling across the Caribbean.

A key observation relates to Data Protection Acts, which have gained significant traction post-2018, after the implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Notably, six out of the eleven CARICOM countries with enacted data protection laws passed them since 2018\u2014St Kitts and Nevis (2018), Barbados (2019), Jamaica (2020), Belize (2021), Guyana (2023), and Grenada (2023)\u2014suggesting strong influence from the GDPR model and its emphasis on privacy, consent, and accountability. Earlier adopters like The Bahamas (2003) and St Lucia (2011) reflect pre-GDPR frameworks that may now be considered in need of modernization to align with international standards.</p> <p>For Computer Misuse legislation, adoption began as early as 2003 (Bahamas), but gained momentum post-2015. These laws address the rising threat of cybercrime, with most nations enacting statutes between 2015 and 2022. This mirrors global trends following increased awareness of cyber threats and the 2013\u20132017 uptick in ransomware and government breaches worldwide. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, while not ratified by most CARICOM nations, appears to have indirectly influenced these laws<sup>3</sup>.</p> <p>Electronic Transactions laws were among the earliest digital laws adopted in the region, reflecting a focus on enabling e-commerce and digital government. Eleven countries have enacted such laws, with early movers like The Bahamas and Belize in 2003, and more recent adoption by Guyana in 2023. This suggests growing prioritization of digital trade and service delivery across the region.</p> <p>Finally, Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation is the most inconsistently adopted framework. Only eight countries have enacted FOI laws, with significant delays or absences in others. The earliest adopters\u2014Jamaica (2002) and Antigua &amp; Barbuda (2004)\u2014contrast with newer efforts in St Kitts &amp; Nevis (2024) and The Bahamas (2017). The patchy implementation reflects challenges in transparency culture, administrative capacity, and political will, a pattern noted in global assessments of FOI law effectiveness in small states.</p> <p>Overall, CARICOM countries are progressively building their digital governance infrastructure. The GDPR appears to have acted as a catalytic force for modern data protection regimes, while regional responses to cyber threats and e-commerce imperatives are shaping broader digital legal frameworks.

But to unlock the transformative potential of data\u2014in research, public services, economic development, and climate resilience\u2014the region must focus on integration, implementation, and innovation.</p> <p>CARICOM should consider a roadmap for a Trusted Regional Data Ecosystem, built on five pillars:</p> <ul> <li>Common legal standards rooted in shared principles but adaptable to national context</li> <li>Mutual trust mechanisms to support lawful cross-border data flows</li> <li>Independent and capable regulators that build public confidence</li> <li>Data stewardship models that balance protection with societal reuse</li> <li>Participatory governance involving civil society, academia, and the private sector</li> </ul> <p>Such a model would not only align the region with global best practices but would also assert a Caribbean voice in global digital governance debates\u2014where small states have much at stake and much to offer.</p> About CaribData <p>CaribData is dedicated to transforming data sharing and storytelling across the Caribbean. The project aims to build a regional infrastructure for data exchange, provide training and mentorship to strengthen data handling capacity, and promote open data through visualization and storytelling. By collaborating with researchers, statisticians, and organizations, we make data more accessible and impactful. CaribData is currently funded by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).</p> <p>We\u2019re actively seeking passionate storytellers and data enthusiasts who can work with us to create compelling narratives.

The city\u2019s historic buildings and sea air give a sense of place, but her focus is on the route ahead - navigating uneven pavement, parked cars, and stretches where the sidewalk ends altogether. </p> <p>\u201cFrom the time I get home, I don\u2019t go out\u201d, she says,reflecting on her evening routine. </p> <p>Like many people living in Bridgetown and the Garrison, she often prefers to stay indoors after dark.</p> <p></p> <p>Wellington Street. Without sidewalks, pedestrians resort to walking in the road</p> <p>Marsha used to walk more, sometimes in the evenings or with her daughter, but now she is more cautious. </p> <p>\u201cI ain\u2019t walk because the crime. At the end of the day, I wanted to exercise, and I was gonna walk downtown, but I say \u2018you know what? I ain\u2019t going there now, because people getting rob every 5 seconds, and I don\u2019t wanna get robbed. I stand home.\u201d </p> <p>This sense of concern is shared by many, particularly women, and is one reason why research shows that women in Barbados\u2014and elsewhere\u2014tend to be less physically active than men. If neighbourhoods are made safer and more inviting, especially after dark, this could help narrow the gap and support everyone\u2019s wellbeing.</p> <p></p> <p>Sidewalk damage</p> <p>Most evenings, Marsha\u2019s walk home is straightforward, but the city\u2019s infrastructure shapes her decisions. Nearly 60% of residential streets in Bridgetown lack sidewalks, according to  recent objective assessment, and only about a third of all city streets have continuous sidewalks. On her route, she often finds herself sharing space with cars or detouring around vehicles parked on narrow verges. The survey also found that many sidewalks are too narrow or in poor condition, making it harder to walk comfortably, especially with children or bags. </p> <p>Lighting is another concern. </p> <p>\u201cSometimes they got roads out there that pitch black. You gotta walk in the pitch black till you get to a street light. You get in that little bit of light, then back in that pitch dark. They need more street lights\u201d. </p> <p>Recent research on walkability found that fear of crime and poor lighting were the most common reasons given for avoiding walking after sunset, especially among women. Objective data confirms that while most streets have some lighting, very few are well-lit throughout, and less than a third of streets have traffic calming features to slow vehicles.</p> <p>There are, however, positive examples. Marsha enjoys walking around Bayland or the Garrison, especially in the morning when more people are about and the area feels safer. </p> <p>\u201cI does walk straight round Bayland. Sometimes, I extend it by doing it round the Garrison\u201d. </p> <p>Residents highlighted areas like Collymore Rock and Culloden Road as walkable and social, supported by the objective findings showing these areas are better maintained, with more complete sidewalks.</p> <p></p> <p>A nice area to walk, run, skip or chat. The garrison is known for its big horsing racing day and it's exercising activities on a daily basis. People love it there.</p> <p>On less inviting streets, Marsha occasionally encounters obstacles like garbage or overgrown verges. </p> <p>\u201cAll is full garbage, and thousands of rats. I had to run from one already. It run out and past my foot. And then the whole area right there, the sidewalk is break in. I run my foot in it already\u201d. </p> <p>These maintenance issues add to the reluctance to walk and highlight the importance of regular upkeep. The city audit found that green spaces and benches are limited, and the lack of these amenities makes it harder to pause, rest, or simply enjoy walking.</p> <p></p> <p>Sidewalk obstacles</p> <p>But the potential for improvement is clear. Research shows that even small, targeted actions could transform the pedestrian experience in Bridgetown. Fixing broken sidewalks, resurfacing paths, and widening narrow walkways would ensure people can walk safely without having to step into traffic. Increasing the number and brightness of streetlights, particularly along routes frequently used by pedestrians, would reduce dark areas and make walking at night less intimidating. Traffic calming measures such as raised crossings or speed bumps could help slow vehicles on busy or narrow streets, especially near schools, bus stops, or shops. Establishing designated \u2018safe routes\u2019 that link neighbourhoods with public transport, markets, recreational spaces, and health centres would give people a clear, reliable path to move through the city. Keeping these routes clean and clear through regular garbage collection, debushing, and removal of hazards would show residents that their comfort and safety matter. And in areas of persistent safety concerns, a more visible community policing presence could help restore public confidence in walking after dark.</p> <p>Studies show that even a 10% increase in walkability can result in as much as 80 more minutes of physical activity per person each week. This leads to better health outcomes, reduced traffic congestion, lower emissions, and stronger social connections among neighbours.</p> <p>Back at home, Marsha thinks about the kind of city she\u2019d like to see: one where safe, well-lit streets and reliable sidewalks make walking a part of daily life for everyone. If these changes are made, she believes more people\u2014including women and girls\u2014will feel comfortable getting outside, whether it\u2019s for exercise, errands, or simply enjoying the neighbourhood.</p> <p>Bridgetown has the data. It has the stories. And we know what works. Now is the time to act. Whether through local government initiatives, community partnerships, or advocacy by residents themselves, the momentum to create a safer, more walkable city must be sustained. With steady, practical improvements, Bridgetown and its Garrison can become a place where walking is not only possible but pleasurable\u2014for locals and tourists alike. Every cracked pavement repaired, every streetlight installed, every safe route mapped is a step toward a healthier, more inclusive city.
