    ## From Foundation to Momentum: Exploring Opportunities to Advance Belize‚Äôs NCD Agenda

    Belize‚Äôs performance on the PAHO NCD Scorecard between 2020 and 2025 shows steady effort and highlights areas that may benefit from further attention. 

    Belize has consistently implemented 5 of 22 recommended policies, with meaningful progress in areas such as tobacco control, mortality surveillance, and national health surveys like the World Health Organization's STEPS.

    The chart shows how governments across the Americas are progressing as of 2025, with Canada leading in total implemented policies. Belize appears in the mid-to-lower tier of regional performance, which could represent a valuable opportunity to explore. Many of the indicators not yet implemented (12 in 2025) are well-defined and closely aligned with cost-effective WHO ‚ÄúBest Buys.‚Äù These may offer feasible next steps for rapid gains, should the conditions allow.

    Some areas that may be worth exploring further include:

    - **Nutrition and alcohol policy:** There may be room to consider fiscal and labelling reforms, and to examine availability measures.
    - **Multisector collaboration:** Revisiting national targets or reactivating a multisector NCD strategy may help enhance alignment across sectors 

    Encouragingly, many building blocks are already in place‚Äîstrong mortality data, routine national surveys, and a published NCD plan. The next phase might involve identifying where momentum can be accelerated and coordination enhanced.

    ### Suggested Next Steps
    
    - **Data systems:** Consider how existing data systems could inform refreshed national targets.
    - **NCD Commission:** Explore whether reactivating the NCD Commission might strengthen cross-sector collaboration.
    - **Interventions:** Identify practical, short-term interventions (e.g. targeted campaigns or school-based changes) that could build visibility and momentum.

    Belize has a strong foundation. With continued collaboration and targeted effort, the path ahead may be a promising one.

    ## Healthy Students, Healthy Futures: A Space for Education in Belize‚Äôs NCD Response

    2025 PAHO Scorecard provides insight into national progress in addressing noncommunicable diseases‚Äîand it highlights a potential role for the education sector in Belize. Of the 22 assessed policies, a few directly touch school environments: physical activity, healthy food in schools, and marketing restrictions to protect children. Belize had not yet implemented policies in these areas as of 2025, which may offer an opportunity to engage.

    collaboration between education and health stakeholders‚Äîsuch as improvements to school meals and the delivery of HFLE curricula‚Äîsuggests that the sector is already positioned to contribute meaningfully. Schools are uniquely placed to reach students early, before unhealthy behaviours take hold.

    The data also highlights areas of concern:

    - Approximately 80% of Belizean adults are physically inactive.
    - Fruit and vegetable intake remains well below WHO recommendations.
    - There are no regulations yet on the marketing of unhealthy foods near schools.

    At the same time, these data may present opportunities for targeted action‚Äîespecially in school settings where reach and influence are high.

    ### Ideas to Consider:

    - Phased introduction of simple nutrition and activity standards across schools.
    - Strengthening HFLE content with a focus on NCD prevention and teacher support.
    - Exploring ways to limit exposure to harmful marketing in and around schools.

    When education leads on health, the benefits often ripple outward to families and communities. Positioning schools as champions of wellness may be one way to support a healthier future for Belize.

    ## Belize‚Äôs Health Scorecard: What Would It Take to Turn More Greens On?

    Did you know that Belize has a national ‚Äúhealth report card‚Äù? It‚Äôs called the PAHO Scorecard, and it checks how well different policies are working to help people stay healthy. These include things like offering better food options, protecting young people from tobacco and alcohol ads, and creating more chances to get active.

    ### Here‚Äôs how Belize did in 2025:

    Out of 22 possible green lights, Belize got 5. That shows progress in areas like tobacco laws and health surveys‚Äîbut also points to places where more could be done. There are still 17 policies not yet marked green. That could mean there's still lots of room to grow.

    Some of the issues that matter most to students‚Äîlike better school meals, more time to move around, and fewer junk food ads‚Äîaren‚Äôt fully addressed yet. But there‚Äôs a chance to make a difference.

    What You Might Try: üèÉüèΩ Join or start a walking club or dance group at your school

    üçç Talk to your school about offering more healthy food choices

    üó£Ô∏è Share what you‚Äôve learned with your family and friends

    Every little bit helps. If students, teachers, and families work together, Belize could improve its scorecard‚Äîand you could be part of the change.
